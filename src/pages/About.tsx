              We believe local problems need local solutions. We recognize the expertise
               of community leaders and invest in their ability to respond to problems on their own terms. 
               When local leaders are given the chance to lead, they create innovative solutions to 
               combat poverty that outsiders may miss. 

We believe in the power of the #girleffect. 
Investing in girls transforms their lives and uplifts their families and communities.

We stand by our Child Protection Policy. 
The protection of children is an integral component of KGSA’s approach:
 that girls receive a quality education in which their rights are respected and they
  feel safe and protected.

                    returned to KGSA in 2007 to teach math and geography. During her 15 plus years 
                    working at KGSA, Claris obtained a Bachelor’s Degree of Education and Counseling 
                    from Kenya Methodist University and was promoted to Head Teacher, Principal and Director.
                     Claris is a beloved teacher and colleague and loves playing soccer.
